### what's different?
- the cubes are actually square (none of the wca icons are actually squares! they were either too wide or too tall :( )
- mega redrawn as current icon is not straight, has random paths, corners aren't corners, and various other inconsistencies
- fmc and mbld icons rescaled to be more inline with the other icons


### details
- 24px x 24px bounded icons
- meets m3 icon guideline with max 20px x 20px live area


#### sizing:
- 2x2 is 14px x 14px
- regular sized icons are 16px x 16px
- 4x4, 5x5, 4bld, 5bld are 18px x 18px
- 6x6, 7x7 are 20px x 20px

- mega and pyra have 18px width (slightly shorter)


#### rounded corners!
- regular sized icons are rounded with 1.2px radius
